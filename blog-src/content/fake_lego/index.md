I've had this Shai Hulud <strike>Lego</strike> brick kit on my wishlist for a long time, and this past holiday someone finally got it for me. Yay!

The exercise of putting it together has reminded me why Legoâ„¢ is the leader in this domain. The fit and polish of this kit is not quite right. Some pieces are clearly of the "Lego would never do that" camp. In particular this kit relies a lot on tiny little nub pieces that allow you to connect the "back" of 2 bricks to eachother. It's a clever hack, but it's *so damn fiddly* that I can understand why lego never implemented such a mechanic.

Also this kit uses some rubber connectors to give the worm flexibility-- which, again, is a clever hack, but Lego would never do that. There'd be some clever pivoting stuff instead.

I guess I'm a Lego snob.
