I went with some friends to go see the new Fantastic Four movie today.

I should start off with: I am not a superhero story fan. I've seen my fair share of the MCU movies over the years, and some of the DC universe movies as well. I keep giving them a chance, because I love well crafted speculative fiction (SF) stories, and that's all a superhero movie is, really.

The best SF stories are a fun or interesting parable to the real world. A funhouse mirror reflection of life, helping to highlight certain aspects of the way the world works, or what it means to be human. Even if the story is about aliens or elves or a flying mutant raccoon, it's about being human. Even when the story is about a made up land, another planet, or another dimension, it's about still borrowing _something_ from the world we live in.

_Dune_ does an excellent job of setting up a parable about an oppressed people who happen to live on some land that has natural resources that more powerful militaristic people seek to exploit and control. The world is well thought out and the journey of the characters along the way serves as a more relatable story interwoven with that broader tale.

The politics in _Lord of the Rings_ definitely take a back seat to the hero's journey. Ultimately LotR is a story about when evil rears up in the world, even the most humble and ordinary person can defeat it.

_Game of Thrones_ (or _A Song of Ice and Fire_ for you book nerds ðŸ˜‰) is less preachy about the hero(es) journeys, since many of them involve being put in shitty situations and they do what they have to in order to survive... or they just straight up die. Which makes it probably the most realistic 'fantasy' story I've ever consumed. The focus is on the politics of vying for political power, but the existential threat of the night walkers has obvious parallels to the looming existential threat of climate change.

I also give props to _The Expanse_ for depicting a universe that is constantly struggling with political factions vying for power. There's never a "and they all lived happily ever after" wrap up.

Superhero stories are often just stories of "if we punch the bad guy hard enough, everything would be solved forever". That storyline works if you're telling a person vs. person tale. Assuming the struggle is of irreconcileable differences, then yeah, if you physically defeat the opposition, you've won. Good job, you killed the bad guy.

In many (most?) superhero movies it ends up being about saving _the entire world_. Gotta defeat Thanos. Gotta defeat Galactus. Gotta defeat Ultron. It's one god-like entity out to destroy/kill everything, and they're doing it solo. Or maybe they're doing it with an army of mindless drone-like emissaries, for which we are to have no empathy. **That is not how the world works.** The most dangerous people are not operating solo, they are a figurehead at the
