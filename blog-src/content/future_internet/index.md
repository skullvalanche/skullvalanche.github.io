There's a movement on the internet to embrace the "small web". Simplistic websites, often self-hosted on basic hardware, with little or no big corporate infrastructure involved. I interpret this as a few things coming together: 

1. Backlash against the giant corporate owned internet, in which a handful of companies own and run massive platforms that host everything.

2. A nostalgia for the simplicity of the early internet, where you could just put up a website on a computer sitting in your closet.

The technical bar to "safely" running something publicly available on the web in 2025 is massive compared to what was needed in 1995. Largely because there's an army of baddies out there who are constantly poking at the defenses of anything public looking for holes.

The idea of "small web" appeals to me.
