I don't like Fleetwood Mac. I don't think I've ever purposefully played a Fleetwood Mac song, except to maybe win an argument or something. I do, however, like Stevie Nicks' voice. I did a deep dive on Stevie's solo catalog a while back to verify something though.

I don't like Stevie Nicks' music.

This presents a weird situation in which I enjoy many artists who are clearly _influenced_ by Stevie Nicks, but don't like the source material. I even have a list of artists who I categorize as influenced by her, but make different (better?) musical choices.

Only 2 exceptions leap to mind:

- Stop Draggin' My Heart Around (with Tom Petty)
- Stand Back

Probably because both those songs don't feel like her typical stuff.

I wish she'd do more collabs with artists who's musical styles I like. Though, at 76 years old, I think time may be running short for that to happen.

Anyway, I keep a list of artists who I think owe a debt of gratitude to Stevie, and that'll hafta tide me over.
