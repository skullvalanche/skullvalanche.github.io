Years ago I read a very humorous "building a PC for grandma" blog post that has stuck with me over the years, because it was an over-the-top parody of everything that is wrong with hardcore tech nerds writing articles for the general public. By the end of the article, grandma's computer was a dual-boot water-cooled Linux + Windows gaming PC that was absurd overkill for grandma's proposed use case of "getting on the internet".

I promise I will try to never write a tutorial like that. I don't want to make any assumptions about people's tech knowledge, so I try to keep things understandable and explain stuff in plain English.

That said, here goes...

# Why do this at all?

Media files are somewhat unique compared to other files you likely have on your computer. They are unique in that they are typically "read only" -- meaning you don't generally *edit* them, you just *consume* them. The benefit of that is it means they can easily be shifted off your local computer to their own *dedicated* computer with its own dedicated storage drive(s) to avoid filling up your storage on your daily-driver devices.

Now, you *can* upload media files to various "cloud" storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon, etc) to get them off your local devices, but depending on how much media you have, that can get quite expensive paying a regular fee to a data storage service. Feel free to crunch some numbers and see if that's worth it for your situation. (In which case, feel free to ignore this blog post. 😅)

Speaking for myself, I have far too much media data to be worth paying someone else to store it for me. (It would likely be hundreds of dollars a month.)

Which brings us to the most budget friendly option: **self-hosting** 🎉

Storing media files on a computer you own (self-hosting) is basically free, other than paying for the electricity needed to keep the computer running.

Now, not everyone has a spare computer handy for this, so admittedly there is potentially the one-time cost of obtaining a computer with enough storage to handle being a media storage server, but old computers are generally easy to come by for cheap, and this setup *does not* require a particularly fast computer. The thing to consider most is *storage* -- make sure you have a large enough drive to hold all your media (with room to spare).

Let's say we have 2 TB of media.
