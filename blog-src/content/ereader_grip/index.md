I recently got a Kobo e-ink tablet to replace my Kindle. Amazon's efforts to exert control over the Kindle devices [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html) [2](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/index.php?title=Amazon_Kindle_removes_download_feature_of_purchased_books) finally pushed me to drop the platform entirely. The device still works, and maybe I'll jailbreak it to free it from Amazon's control, but on principle I'm just giving up on it.

My Kobo reader is pretty identical in form-factor to the Kindle. Most e-ink readers are pretty similar in size, unless they're doubling as a writing tablet, but at that point I don't think of them as "reader" devices.

So I have a couple e-reader devices, and they all suffer from the same problem: they're designed to be slim and light and are incredibly uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time. They're not really one handed devices. They're _light_ enough to be one-handed, but they're too wide to be gripped/held like a phone.

As I was holding my new Kobo, my hand was cramping up and I thought about what would be better.

I wanted something more ergonomic. Something that would feel more like holding a tool. Maybe something like a game controller? Those are designed to be held for long stretches of time.

So I searched around some 3D printing models and found a game controller grip designed for a phone. Not bad, I can probably modify the dimensions a bit to make it fit a tablet. After all, it's just a bigger slab shape.

I ended up with this:

This was pretty comfy, but suffered from a few drawbacks. It was too low on the device. My thumb could only just barely reach the touch screen's lower right quadrant without doing some awkward hand gymnastics. Also, the grips flare out, which means the weight distribution of the device is further away during one-handed use, making it feel heavier.
