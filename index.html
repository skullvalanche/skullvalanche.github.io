            <h2>What the hell am I looking at?</h2>
            In Return of the King, the 3rd film of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, some movie wizards thought it would be cool to throw
            in a scene in which our heroes were put upon by an avalanche of skulls. The scene involved quite a lot of CG
            rendering, was likely $1,000,000+ to make, and ultimately was left out of the theatrical version of the film.
            It wasn't even in the Tolkein books. It was the brain-child of a Hollywood movie committee.

            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            I'm just some guy, y'know?<br />
            <br>
            I like woodworking, coding, climate science, weird fruit facts, rye whiskey, stout beers, biking, B-movies, and spending inordinate amounts of time thinking about music.<br>
