            <h2>What the hell am I looking at?</h2>
            In Return of the King, the 3rd film of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, some movie wizards thought it would be cool to throw
            in a scene in which our heroes were put upon by an avalanche of skulls. The scene involved quite a lot of CG
            rendering, was likely $1,000,000+ to make, and ultimately was left out of the theatrical version of the film.
            It wasn't even in the Tolkein books. It was the brain-child of a Hollywood movie committee.

            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            I'm a guy who codes things and sometimes streams on <a href="https://twitch.tv/skullvalanche">Twitch</a> while
            doing so.
            <h2>What do you code?</h2>
            <p><em>Full disclaimer: I'm not a professional software engineer.</em> I do most of my coding for fun. I noticed
                there was a big gap in knowledge on Twitch between the professional coders who were doing very cool but very
                complex projects, and newbies who were just doing code tutorials. I try to keep my streams accessible to
                newbies with no programming experience. If you're just starting out, or you've never written code before,
                then (hopefully) this is the stream for you.</p>
